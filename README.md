## Getting started & software prerequisites

There are three ways to get started with these materials, with each of them requiring different software installed on your computer.

#### JupyterHub

If you're taking this workshop at D-Lab, then your instructor will have set up JupyterHub for your workshop. The JupyterHub allows you to run code on a remote computer but see the results on yours. For this method, the only software you need is a modern web browser (we suggest Google Chrome). Your instructor will give you a URL on the day. This is our recommended method.

#### Anaconda

If you want to run the code on your computer, you have two options. Both involve installing (or making sure you have installed) Python 3 and some additional libraries. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) is a **free** product that makes the installation process easy. It bundles together the Python language and a whole bunch of additional packages that we often rely on in our workshops. This way, you only have to download and install one thing. To use this method, visit [this site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and follow the instructions for your operating system to download the Python 3.x version (it might be 3.6, or 3.7, or higher). **Please, please, please download the 3.x version, not the Python 2.x version**. You may have a choice between using the graphical installer or the command line installer. Use whichever you're comfortable with, but the graphical one is easier.

#### For Pythonistas

If you've been using Python for a while, you might not want to use Anaconda. First, make sure you have a Python 3.x version. Second, install Jupyter by following [these instructions](http://jupyter.org/install). Third, install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file of this repo. The easiest way to do this is:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## IOKN2K

It's OK Not To Know! That's our motto at [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/). D-Lab is open to researchers and professionals from all disciplines and levels of experience.
