    "### What is sentiment analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to perform [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) on a dataset of tweets about US airlines. Sentiment analysis is the task of extracting [affective states][1] from text. Sentiment analysis is most ofen used to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)\n",
    "\n",
    "- _what do our customers think of us?_\n",
    "- _do our users like the look of our product?_\n",
    "- _what aspects of our service are users dissatisfied with?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment analysis as text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to treat sentiment analysis as a text classification problem. Text classification is just like other instances of classification in data science. We use the term \"text classification\" when the features come from natural language data. (You'll also hear it called \"document classification\" at times.) What makes text classification interestingly different from other instances of classification is the way we extract numerical features from text. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was collected by [Crowdflower](https://www.crowdflower.com/), which they then made public through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment). I've downloaded it for you and put it in the \"data\" directory. Note that this is a nice clean dataset; not the norm in real-life data science! I've chosen this dataset so that we can concentrate on understanding what text classification is and how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we'll cover in our hour. Like any data science task, we'll first do some EDA to understand what data we've got. Then, like always, we'll have to preprocess our data. Because this is text data, it'll be a little different from preprocessing other types of data. Next we'll perform our sentiment classification. Finally, we'll interpret the results of the classifier in terms of our big question.\n",

    "We'll cover:\n",

    "### Final note\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you don't follow every single step in our hour. If things are moving too quickly, concentrate on the big picture. Afterwards, you can go through the notebook line by line to understand all the details."

    "Now that we've cleaned the text, we need to turn the text into numbers for our classifier. We're going to use a \"bag of words\" as our features. A bag of words is just like a frequency count of all the words that appear in a tweet. It's called a bag because we ignore the order of the words; we just care about what words are in the tweet. To do this, we can use `scikit-learn`'s `CountVectorizer`. `CountVectorizer` replaces each tweet with a vector (think a list) of counts. Each position in the vector represents a unique word in the corpus. The value of an entry in a vector represents the number of times that word appeared in that tweet. Below, we restrict the length of the vectors to be 5,000 and the counts to be 0 (not in the tweet) and 1 (in the tweet)."
