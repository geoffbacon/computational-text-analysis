Again, there are many different [alternatives](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/tree/develop/nltk/tag), but NLTK keeps its recommended POS tagger available through the function `pos_tag`. The tagger expects a list of tokens as input.When doing POS tagging, it is advisable **not** to remove stop words beforehand (although you are free to do it afterwards)."
